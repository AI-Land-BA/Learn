A project I came up with when Porter was doing his Python lessons -- A good python capstone project:

Take the twitter data feed for political accounts (GovTrack?) and, identify political subjects mentioned in each post.
Then, for each identified subject, calculate the Sentiment around the subject mentions. This should then add up into a global sent-vector 
for each polilitian and, we should be able to compute something like a tag-cloud for each Sent for politication, party, etc. and render 
it graphically -- Wordle would be good for this. Also, here is a Wordle Alternative:
